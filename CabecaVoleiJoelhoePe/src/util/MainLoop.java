/**
 * Controls the main loop. This class will try to update the logics in a
 * fixed rate per second (ups). This guarantees consistence among animations
 * both in high and low speed computers.
 * <p>
 * The number of frames draw per second will vary according to the hardware and
 * to the game processing time. If the hardware is fast enough one frame will be
 * updated per logics update (that is, fps == ups). The sleep time between
 * frames will be automatically calculated and maintained.
 * <p>
 * If the hardware is not fast enough, there will be no sleep time between
 * frames. Since this could hang all the other threads, the loop will generate
 * an yield signal every time the noDelaysPerYield count is achieved.
 * <p>
 * The excess time to render a frame will be accumulated every cicle. When this
 * represents an error big enough to skip a frame, the frame will be
 * automatically skiped. The maximum number of frames skiped in one single step
 * is given by the maxFrameSkips attribute.
 * <p>
 * To start the MainLoop call the run() method. For convenience, the
 * <code>MainLoop</code> class implements the runnable interface.
 * <p>
 * The code was found in the link below
